# Graph_Traversal_Algorithms
This is a python program for search a node in graph. The algorithms discussed in this program can be applied to Artificially Intelligent agent for searching Goal states out of many graph nodes/states.


In AI a very common problem is to achieve some goal automatically with minimal human intervention.


In order to do so a machine needs to be aware about its initial state, goal state and the enviornment around it. Also, it needs algorithms to get from the initial state to the goal state OPTIMALLY.


This transforms into typical graph search/traversal problem.


In the given code we try to implement 3 algorithms for doing this:

1. BFS
2. UCS (Uniform Cost Search)
3. A* Algorithm (Heuristic based algorithm)


As this was a class project so I also attached a sample input file for understanding the restrictions in the input format addressing a specific problem . The problem text is also attached for reference.
